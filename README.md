üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @teleclimber aka Olivier Forget.

I'm currently working on [Dropserver](https://github.com/teleclimber/Dropserver), an open source server for your personal web apps.

As part of this I'm also working on apps for Dropserver, largely to demonstrate the capabilities of the platform and do my own "dogfooding". See:
- A very simple secret santa app for Dropserver: https://github.com/teleclimber/SecretSantaDropApp
- Leftovers app helps reduce food waste by tracking leftovers in the refrigerator: https://github.com/teleclimber/Leftovers
